/*
Create a Shape class, a Rectangle class and a Circle class as described below.
A shape has the following attributes:
• an x position and a y position.
• a colour (recorded as separate red, green and blue values).
The position records the position of the shape on some grid coordinate system. The colour
records the colour of the shape using the standard red-green-blue colour system (0 to 255).
A circle extends a shape by adding:
• a radius
while a rectangle extends a shape by adding:
• a height and width.
Add appropriate setters and getters for all of the attributes described above
